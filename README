Hand Detection using Color Recognition

Software to detect hand from videostream (webcam) and detect fingertips, number of fingers etc.

The software is compiled using the Makefile. Simply run 

  $make

In the terminal. In the future I will add instructions on how to compile with Visual Studio, as there has been alot of 
requests for this
