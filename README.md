Hand Detection using Color Recognition
=================================

Software to detect hand from videostream (webcam) and detect fingertips, number of fingers etc.
The software is based on openCV,

The software is compiled using the Makefile. Simply run 

	$make

in the terminal if you use Linux Or Mac. In the future I will add instructions on how to compile with Visual Studio, as there has been alot of 
requests for this
